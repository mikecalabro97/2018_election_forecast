# 2018_election_forecast

It is my belief that, after the election, the Republicans will control the Senate, and the Democrats will control the House. Currently in class, we are having a discussion as to how we should approach this prediction, whether we should be vague or specific, whether we should follow the predictions of professionals or make bold counter claims in an effort to become famous, et cetera. I tend to lean towards trusting the professionals, like the statisticians at fivethirtyeight, when making my predictions. Sure, people throw a lot of shade at them for their 2016 presidential elections, but they never said there was a 100% chance Hillary would win, and the thing with stats is that sometimes the 20-percenter wins (2/10 times, to be exact). I am not trying to be a famous political pundit, I don't know enough about this election to make an informed prediction, and I appreciate you wanting to write a kind reccomendation for us, but I don't think my political prowess is my biggest strength.
